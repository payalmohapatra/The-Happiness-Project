# The-Happiness-Project
What makes you happy?
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Happiness is a subjective emotion and means very different to everyone. However, it is
without a doubt that it is one of the most sought-after things in the world. In our project,
we attempt to objectively analyze the causality between happiness and country-wide
metrics like GDP, social security, life expectancy at birth, etc.
PREPARATION OF DATASET & FEATURES
We plan to use the official datasets provided by World Happiness Report, which are
pre-processed (parsed into columns and updated with missing datapoints) in Kaggle.
METHODOLOGY
● Conduct a preliminary inspection (data visualisation, cross-correlation etc.) to
understand which features to be included in the model development.
● Develop a model to calculate the happiness quotient.
○ Experiment with various supervised machine learning techniques for
regression and arrive at the best model for this dataset.
○ Segment available datasets as training, development, and test data to
develop and verify the model.
○ Compute relevant performance metrics to evaluate the performance of the
model.
● Utilize regularisation techniques to find which metrics highly correlate with the
happiest countries over the years.
● Present a report of the happiness score analysis.
